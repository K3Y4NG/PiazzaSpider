The AIMA book says an environment is discrete if it has a \"finite number of distinct states\" (is that the same as a finite number of percept/action pairs?).

Thank you for your answer. I fully understand your point because it's true that B exists in front of D in the priority queue. We will have 2 same path-cost nodes(C and D) in frontier set when the left route reaches node C and the right route reaches node D.Therefore it really makes sense that the result should depend on the sequence of C-F and D-F in the input.txt.\n  But I think my understanding makes sense as well since node A is the very first node that these 2 optimal routes begin to split. When it comes to 2 different optimal routes, the instruction in the homework asks us to \"explore (enqueue) multiple paths from the same intersection in the order in which they are listed in the live traffic inputs\".

Is it correct ?\n  S 0\nB 1\nC 2\nE 3\nZ 4\n ", "student_answer": [], "followup": [{"name": "Khanh Duy Le (anon. to classmates)", "time": "Tue Sep 13 2016 14:55:41 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "text": "I think the BFS output should be : \n  S 0\nA 1\nC 2\nE 3\nZ 4", "replies": []}]}, {"title": "What's the meaning of score 0/3 when test case passed?", "number": "88", "time": "Sat Sep 10 2016 23:27:20 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "author": ["Ma Luo (anon. to classmates)"], "text": "I do not understand the line 'score 0/3' in my report, please tell me what it means, thanks a lot!\n  My test case result is as follow:\n  Input File:                                                                                                                             \n    BFS                                                                                                                                     \n    A                                                                                                                                       \n    D                                                                                                                                       \n    4                                                                                                                                       \n    A B 5                                                                                                                                   \n    A C 3                                                                                                                                   \n    B D 1                                                                                                                                   \n    C D 2                                                                                                                                   \n    4                                                                                                                                       \n    A 4\n    B 1                                                                                                                                     \n    C 1                                                                                                                                     \n    D 0                                                                                                                                     \n    Content from your output file:                                                                                                          \n    Score: 0/3                                                                                                                              \n    test case passed!

Let's call it frontier (more general, not related to any abstract data type). it is place where we keep the nodes that we want to explore in the future.\n  Actually, the search algorithms work by removing elements from the frontier, exploring them and adding them back. But which node should I explore in the frontier, how to process it and where to add it? We need to maintain some order in the frontier. The order in which we pull out the nodes from the frontier gave rise to the different search strategies.\n  All search strategies require a start point, we are searching a graph. The search grows/builds up/moves forward from the current node (this is done by exploring the neighbors, if available) or traverse back to explore another path. But which order do we explore the multiple neighbors? Here comes our favorite part of the entire homework, tie breaker.\n  So, Its important to know how we pop out the nodes than how we put it in, which defines the search strategy. The tie-breakers want us to answer this question: \"Which one of my neighbors do I take to explore next?\"\n  The tie-breaker that we are asked to implement is by popping from the frontier (all the neighbors, if available) in such a way that we explore the paths that have occurred earlier in the live traffic input. If we look at it from \"popping the elements out of frontier\" perspective, we can have many things clarified. So we add to the frontier in such a way that we remove nodes from frontier from them \"as given in the tie breaker\".\n  Many a times, to make things easy for us to understand, reading materials may point us to use a Stack ADT for DFS and a Queue ADT for BFS and other strategies which shouldn't be confused with the Queueing-Fn/en-queueing etc.\n---------------\n  It would be great if an instructor can endorse it or correct my understanding."}], "followup": []}, {"title": "Output.txt file not found- Vocareum error", "number": "137", "time": "Fri Sep 16 2016 21:58:43 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "author": ["Santhana Gopalan Raghavan (anon. to classmates)"], "text": "Hi!,\n\nMy code works well in the Dev c++ IDE but Vocareum throws the following error:\n[Executed at: Fri Sep 16 21:42:33 PDT 2016]                                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                      Output file not found.                                                                                                                                       \n    Input File:                                                                                                                                                  \n    BFS                                                                                                                                                          \n    A                                                                                                                                                            \n    D                                                                                                                                                            \n    4                                                                                                                                                            \n    A B 5                                                                                                                                                        \n    A C 3                                                                                                                                                        \n    B D 1                                                                                                                                                        \n    C D 2                                                                                                                                                        \n    4                                                                                                                                                            \n    A 4                                                                                                                                                          \n    B 1                                                                                                                                                          \n    C 1                                                                                                                                                          \n    D 0                         \n    ./.vocSubmissionShellScriptInternal_19422.sh: line 55:  9141 Segmentation fault      ./homework.out -i $ASNLIB/input.txt\nHelp would be appreciated.\nThanks.", "student_answer": [{"author": ["Timothy Wade"], "time": "Sat Sep 17 2016 10:19:55 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "text": "Files names are case sensitive -- did you confirm you're conforming to the expected case?"}], "followup": [{"name": "Santhana Gopalan Raghavan (anon. to classmates)", "time": "Sat Sep 17 2016 16:12:11 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "text": "yes! the name of my output file is output.txt, input being input.txt and code file- homework.cpp\n ", "replies": [{"name": "Santhana Gopalan Raghavan (anon. to classmates)", "time": "Sat Sep 17 2016 16:19:17 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "text": "works fine now..thanks"}, {"name": "Omid Davtalab", "time": "Sat Sep 17 2016 18:47:14 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "text": "This is working fine for cpp files and I tested it.

The right thing to do is as follows:\n  1. Search through all stake actions from top left to bottom right\n2. Search through all raid actions from top left to bottom right\n  To determine whether or not a raid can be performed at tile (X,Y), look at its neighbors and see if the player also owns one of the neighboring pieces. If the player does own at least one such piece and (X,Y) is open, then a raid can be performed. Do this for all (X,Y) from top left to bottom right to find the raid actions. If you search the actions in order as above and only update them when an action of strictly better value is found, you will arrive at the correct answer in cases of tie-breaking. The reason the order of the neighbors doesn't matter is you are only using them to determine whether or not a raid is performable at a given tile (X,Y). then you will get a list of raid actions in order of the board (top left to bottom right), and the order in which you test neighbors does not matter.

So any equal value we get in minimax is accurate and exact.\n  But in alpha-beta pruning, we can't give this priority as we do in minimax. (if we are adhering to the textbook algorithm) In general, our normal alpha-beta pruning algorithm only initialize alpha and beta value once at the root of the tree, which should be -infinity and +infinity. So any later steps will only update alpha and beta value, not initializing them. (here I have to mention this point, because this point is the mainly difference cause the trouble, And I believe lots of students may have this problem if they write their alpha-beta pruning based on their minimax. Because it is easy to write into a different alpha-beta pruning but get same results with test case 3)\n  So the different way to do the alpha-beta pruning is that we initialize alpha and beta value every time we get back to depth 1. (in our homework, depth 1 is the step we place our first player on the board)\n  Here I will call the normal alpha-beta pruning as #1, and another one as #2.\nIf we use #1 and #2 both on the same board, we will get different sequence of values at depth 1. Here I will give an example (I think it is also reasonable based on definition):\n2\nALPHABETA\nX\n2\n1 2\n1 2\n..\n..\nvalues at depth 1 of #1: -1 0 0 0\nvalues at depth 1 of #2: -1 0 -1 0\n  Now lets get back to our homework test case 3\nThe results of #1:\nA5 Stake\n..XX.\n..XOX\n...O.\n..OO.\nX....\nand the values at depth 1 is:\n-12 -15 X X -11\n-11 -11 X O X\n-12 -18 26 O 24\n25 25 O O 23\n26 26 26 26 23\n  The results of #2 is same with test case 3, and the values at depth 1 is:\n-12 -16 X X -11\n-12 -28 X O X\n-12 -46 26 O -31\n-35 -28 O O -30\n-7 -55 -46 -46 -33\n  It is obvious that #2 can give correct answer (I mean \"correct\" result matched with test case 3), and make me pass every cases provided.

If you emailed already, you will still not get back a response.\n- It is necessary that you know your Crowdmark paper number. This number can be found on the top right portion under the QR code and under \"midterm1\" beginning with a # and before the page number (e.g. 2 of 9). This number will be between 1 to 600. Your regrading request will not be accepted without referencing this Crowdmark paper number.\n  - To request a regrade, please fill in the form (link below) before Thursday night (midnight), which is a little more than 48 hours from now. You will need to sign into your USC Google account to access this form, and it records your email address too. The form asks which question you are asking for a regrade on, from Q1 to Q6. If you have questions on multiple subparts, e.g. 3(a) and 3(c), mention them all in the justification text box. You can fill up the form again for a different question. Please keep your justification brief and to the point.\nThe link to the regrade request form is - Regrading Form Link\n  - Most of the regrade requests we get every year are not accepted simply because the students do not read the solutions and rubric carefully or are overly optimistic with their partially correct solutions. For example, in this midterm, do not ask for a regrade if you have committed mistakes like the following - \nOn Q2 - if you don't have the complete path sequence correct for a subpart, you will lose 6 points. For e.g. if the correct path is A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I, and you wrote A-B-C-D-E-G-H-I, you will lose all points for the path (for each subpart). There is no partial grading within that.\nOn Q5 - if you wrote \"Yes\" as the answer, which is wrong, you get a 0/10 and 2/3rds of the class has committed this error. Please don't ask for a regrade in this case. If you wrote \"No\" but failed to provide a correct counter example and fully justified explanation, the same thing holds.\n  - We aim to complete all regrades by next Tuesday night. By then, you should see an additional comment \"regraded\" on your Crowdmark answers page (for whichever question you requested a regrade on), and your grade adjusted accordingly if there was an error earlier in grading.\n  - Please don't post follow-up questions to this post to discuss your regrading issues (such questions will be deleted). You can use the regrading form to let us know if you have questions on your answers or alternative solutions to some questions which we may not have covered in the rubric. If there are still any lingering questions about this, you can email me.\n  Cheers,\nOm Patri\nCS 561 TA\npatri@usc.edu\n#pin", "student_answer": [], "followup": [{"name": "Om Patri", "time": "Fri Oct 28 2016 20:40:27 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "text": "As a follow-up to this, we made a couple of changes in the solutions for regrading.\nQuestion 4 was regraded for all students, and alternative answers as discussed here were accepted.\nQuestion 6(e)'s correct answer is either B, C or D.\nNo other changes were made in the solutions.\n  All the regrading requests, either through the form, or those who emailed me, have been processed.\n  If you still have a concern with your grade for some question in Midterm 1, email me ASAP as I will finalize the grades on Tuesday, and they cannot be changed once finalized.", "replies": [{"name": "Ulan Korabay", "time": "Fri Dec 09 2016 07:15:38 GMT-0800 (PST)", "text": "Why did you regraded only for those who requested?

I am a bit confused about when we should translate an english sentence using an existential quantifier instead of a universal symbol. For most examples in class we used a universal symbol, however the following sentences made me want to use existential symbol at first, since they had \"one's\" and \"a\" as adjectives:\n\"One's mother is one's sibling's mother\" and \" A first cousin is a child of a parent's sibling\"\nWhich made me write the following translations at first:\n\u2203 x,y,z sibling(x,y) ^ mother(z,x) ^ mother(z,y) , meaning x and y are sibling's with the same z mother. Could you please explain why this would be wrong? \nand same for the second sentence:\n\u2203 x,y,w,z FirstCousin(x,y) ^ Parent(z,y) ^ Parent(w,x) ^sibling(w,z), meaning w z are siblings with children x,y whom are first cousins.\n  Thank you!\n   ", "student_answer": [{"author": ["Akshay Deshmukh (anon. to classmates)"], "time": "Fri Oct 28 2016 17:51:36 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "text": "I will divide my answer in 2 parts:\n  1. Consider 2 sets: x \\in {A, B, C} and y \\in {P, Q, R}.\nNow, the FOL sentence correctly translates to \"Everyone in the world is loved by at least one person\". This would mean that P is loved by B, Q is loved by B and R is loved by A. The interpretation satisfies the universal quantifier constraint on y, as given in the sentence, and the interpretation is considered to be correct.\nYour interpretation is \"Everyone in the world loves at least one person\" which would mean that A loves P, B loves Q and C loves Q. In this case, the interpretation does not satisfy the universal quantifier constraint on y and the meaning has been altered as a consequence. In the given example, R is not loved by anyone and since R \\in y, it should be loved by someone in accordance to the FOL statement.\n  2. The given statements are general truths (only when blood relations are considered). Such facts hold in all circumstances and universal quantifiers need to be used. When an existential quantifier is used, there will always be a situation which will not conform with English interpretation.\nFor example, consider this FOL sentence: \u2203 x,y,z sibling(x,y) ^ mother(z,x) ^ mother(z,y). Such a statement implies that there are cases where a sibling of a person may not have the same mother as that person. Such a case is not possible in reality (only blood relations) but the sentence implies that such a case can exist. Existential quantifiers imply searching through sets of positive and negative examples and returning a positive instance.\nFor the next case, consider this FOL sentence: \u2203 x,y,w,z FirstCousin(x,y) ^ Parent(z,y) ^ Parent(w,x) ^sibling(w,z). Likewise, this statement implies that there are cases where a child's first cousin may not be the son/daughter of the person who is the sibling of the child's parent. Such a case is not possible in reality (only blood relations) but the sentence implies that such a case can exist.\nUniversal quantifiers cover all examples in the domain which is being examined. If there is an example which contradicts the universal statement, the statement fails for the entire set. Universal facts are expressed with a universal quantifier. In case of existential quantifiers, the English statement will contain words/phrases which imply a quantity (some, few, etc) which is lesser than the size of the universal set."}], "followup": []}, {"title": "hw3 algorithm typo", "number": "471", "time": "Fri Oct 28 2016 14:16:53 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "author": ["Ana Ascencio"], "text": "The hw3 instructions says that the algorithm we need to use is slide 76.

In the document F2016Lecture14-15, the examples given for resolution refutation only take a negated query which given a Boolean response. In slide 138 of F2016Lecture14-15.pdf, the negated query to the KB acts as a function (supposed to give a name of a person for that query). The resolution steps lead to a contradiction as nothing can be inferred. How was Ellen given as the answer to the query? I did not understand how Ellen was inferred to be a mountain climber. Unlike backward chaining, the substitutions are not backed up.\n  3. If we unified clause 10 with clause 4 with the substitution {x1/Tony, x4/Snow}, the resulting predicate would be ~L(Ellen, Snow). If this is unified with clause 5, it will result in L(Tony, Snow). This clause will recursively unify with clause 4. In this case, when do we stop?

It's just because we can use different tricks on our code. I used an array visited[row][col] to avoid duplicated moves on grid(row,col)[if it was visited, then don't need to visit again]. Because you mentioned that Stake first and then Raid separatelly, I think that the first idea comes to most of students when saw this requirement is to loop over Stake(empty space) first from top-left to bottom-right, and then Raid('X' or 'O') from top-left to bottom-right. Maybe your solution is the better way to avoid duplication, but it's not the ONLY way. It's not FAIR and WISE to say something is definitely wrong!\nAlso, I think this(the way we use) already involved in the implementation details. It should not be discussed. We are supposed to finish our HW individually.\n  Finally, some suggestions for your reference:\n1. There is no any official document(lecture slide, HW description) mentioned that all of the things discussed on Piazza are also the REQUIREMENT for HW. It's just mentioned Piazza is a good way to discuss our questions about this course.\n  2. I really appreciate the lots of time you guys spend to answer students' questions. But, how to make the time you spend on Piazza more MEANINGFUL?\n  Posting a summary for all of additional requirements discussed on Piazza as [Instr Note] to notify every student before deadline(like one week before). [Also it can avoid repeated answers and some similar question]\n  Rather than hoping that all of students would go through all of materials discussed on Piazza. It's impossible for a student who already finished the HW and is overwhelmed by some other HWs on other courses to go through all of posts and discussions before deadline. We are not taking only one class and we are not supposed to know EVERY student's questions. Just like my followup on this topic, I don't think all of students would go through what I said here except some of students who may have same question with me. You mentioned that you modified the instructors answer to that post, maybe only you know that. Students seldom review the posts they saw already. \nThe HW requirement was keeping changing even though time is close to deadline.

I've gone back to the pseudo-code in AIAMA (posted below) but I don't quite understand what some of the statements mean.\n  The way I have it implemented the second recursive Unify call \"Unify(Rest[x], Rest[y], Unify(First[x],First[y],Theta) )\" causes me to fail too early (I think). \n  Say x = (A(v1,v2) | B(v2,Bob) ) and y = (B(Jack,v3) | (~A(v4,v5)))\n  This should unify {v1/v4, v2/Jack, v3/Bob, v5/Jack} which would lead to resolution (B(Jack, Bob) | B(Jack, Bob)) which factors to B(Jack, Bob) correct?\n  If I follow the pseudo code, On the first entry of unify:\n x,y are both lists, The First[x] is A(v1,v2), First[y] is B(Jack,v3). \nI use this in the Unify statement for if x and y are both lists\nSo now when computing Unify for x = A(v1,v2), y = B(Jack,v3)\nBoth x and y are compounds, Op[x] = A Op[y] = B\nSo go to Unify statement where x = A, y = B\nBoth x and y are function symbols and they are not equivalent so I go to \"else return failure\"\nThis cascades up and the whole thing fails here.\n  I also seem to fail on sentences that have different number of predicates. In fact the only time it seems to work is if both sentences have the same number of predicates, the predicates all have the same names, and they are all ordered in the same way. I'm clearly misreading the pseudo code, I'm guessing I'm misunderstanding what is meant by \"Compound?\" \"List?\" and how \"First\" and \"Rest\" are supposed to work.\n  Sorry if this doesn't make any sense. I'll try to explain more if necessary\n        I've tried implementing my own version of unification with a dfs-like search but that hasn't gone well either :/.

I just followed the book's pseudo code. But as I showed it doesn't seem to work if the ordering of the predicates are different. It also fails if there are a different number of predicates, or if some of the predicates don't have matching names. Both of those scenarios occur very often so it doesn't seem like the book's pseudo-code works with them. I've spent a bunch of time trying to force it to work by re-ordering predicates (which helps some) and trying to only match parts of the sentences with the same predicates (which is faulty, because it removes conflicts that might be important), but I still can't seem to do it.

The joint distribution has 2^4 = 16 entries, 15 of which are independent of one another (due to the sum to one constraint).\n\nHowever, in the first part of the answer, I did say that you could parameterize P(C|A) with 2 parameters, even though there are four entries in the CPT. In my opinion, the term \"entries\" is not a good way to describe what is being asked, and I think the question is thus a little vague. So, to answer your question: yes, you only need to values to fully specify P(C|A), but there are four total values in P(C|A) (with two sum to one constraints)\n\nThe reason I think the question is asking for independent parameters is because it is asking for the \"minimum\" number of entries.

When using the D-separation criterion, you may hear the terms \"active trail\", \"path of influence\", etc. I am not sure if you discussed D-separation in class, but the criterion is not difficult to understand.\n  Here is a link that may be of help: http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/scheines/tutor/d-sep.html#explanation. \n  Programs such as the Belief and Decision Network tool at: http://www.aispace.org/downloads.shtml have built in quizzes that you can use to determine if you understand the concepts of D-separation and conditional independence. It may be outside the scope of this course, though, as I am not sure what rules you learned in lecture."}, {"name": "Chai Zheng Xin", "time": "Sat Dec 10 2016 21:32:38 GMT-0800 (PST)", "text": "Thanks for the info."}]}]}, {"title": "how can we do back-propagation with the step activation function?", "number": "837", "time": "Sat Dec 10 2016 20:46:46 GMT-0800 (PST)", "author": ["Jichao Zhong (anon. to classmates)"], "text": "Since the step function has no gradient, how can we use back-propagation?\n  If changing the wieght of AC from -0.1 to 1, the output of C will be 1.\nIf we have the absolute value for the error, that is Error = |Expected \u2013 Observed|, when tha actual is 1 but the expected is 0.\n(which is the opposite to this question) It is obvious that we should decrese the weight.\nBut according to the solution in this question, AC_new = AC + Alpha * Error * A_output, all values are positive, the adjusted weight won't decrease.\nAny idea?\n ", "student_answer": [{"author": ["Pratik Shrikant Kabara (anon. to classmates)"], "time": "Sun Dec 11 2016 12:15:50 GMT-0800 (PST)", "text": "The error should be calculated without absolute symbols.
