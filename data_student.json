The question is  \"Consider the n-queens problem using the \"efficient\" incremental formulation given on\npage 72. Explain why the state space has at least\n(\n\u221a\n3\nn!)\n states and estimate the largest n for\nwhich exhaustive exploration is feasible. (Hint: Derive a lower bound on the branching factor\nby considering the maximum number of squares that a queen can attack in any column.)\".\n  The n-queens problem basically states that you have to place n queens on a n x n chessboard in such a way that no queens threatens each other.\n  The \"efficient\" incremental formulation stated is:\nStates: All possible arrangements of n queens (0 < rt< 8), one per column in the\nleftmost n. columns, with no queen attacking another.\n Actions: Add a queen to any square in the leftmost empty column such that it is not\nattacked by any other queen.\n  I got an expression of the form\nn\u2217(n\u22123)\u2217(n\u22126)\u2217(n\u22129)\u2217...\n because each time you place a queen in a left-most column, you will deny at most 3 more positions on the column just right of it.

So, the differences I see between the algorithms posted above and the one on the slides is that:\n  1) in the one on the slides, the procedure for replacing nodes on the frontier with lower cost nodes is explicitly implemented in terms of queuing and dequeuing functions.\n  2) the algorithm in the slides updates nodes in the closed set as well as nodes in the open set, whereas this does not happen in the algorithm in the textbook or on Wikipedia. However, the way it is written, the node is deleted from the closed set and put back into the open set if we find a better path, which I think may be a mistake. I will email Prof. Itti about this to ask him. I don't understand why you would need to add the node back to the open queue after you have already enumerated its children.

Similarly, P(D|A,B) requires only 4 independent parameters (P(d|a,b), P(d | a, -b), P(d | -a, b), P(d | -a, -b)), because the others can be recovered via sum to one constraints. I hope this helps.\n\nAs I said above and below, I think the question is vague. I believe it is asking for independent parameters, which is the minimum number of independent values required to fully specify a CPT. When I see the term \"entries\", I take that to mean the total number of values in the CPT (some of which are related by normalization constraints)."}, {"time": "Fri Dec 09 2016 09:15:54 GMT-0800 (PST)", "type": "Reply", "text": "I said in my post above that I don't believe that question is asking for CPT entries, as it makes the question rather trivial. The joint distribution has 2^4 = 16 entries, 15 of which are independent of one another (due to the sum to one constraint).\n\nHowever, in the first part of the answer, I did say that you could parameterize P(C|A) with 2 parameters, even though there are four entries in the CPT. In my opinion, the term \"entries\" is not a good way to describe what is being asked, and I think the question is thus a little vague. So, to answer your question: yes, you only need to values to fully specify P(C|A), but there are four total values in P(C|A) (with two sum to one constraints)\n\nThe reason I think the question is asking for independent parameters is because it is asking for the \"minimum\" number of entries.

Recall that if we have a structure with two parents of a common child, e.g., A -> B <- C, where A and C are the parents and B is the child, the path of influence between A and C is blocked unless B (or one of B's descendants) is observed. We have the same structure here between C and F (with the common child being S). Since S is not observed, there is no path of influence between C and F, and they are independent. Since C and F are independent (not conditionally independent), P(C|F) = P(C). Observing F gives us no information about the probability of C. Notice that if S is observed, P(C|F,S) != P(C|S) because observing S activates a path of influence between F and C.

That is expressed with the original statement:\n  (\u2200 x) (mushroom(x) ^ purple(x)) => \u00acpoisonous(x)  which says \"any x, if it is a mushroom and is purple, then it is not poisonous\" In other words, \"Purple mushrooms are not poisonous.\"\n  Likewise for the first case which is a vacuous truth statement: \"\u00ac(\u2203 x) purple(x) ^ mushroom(x) => poisonous(x)\" which means: \"there is not some x, if it is purple and is a mushroom, then it is poisonous\".  Fine, since x cannot be a purple mushroom, let x be a green tomato.  The statement is STILL true, which is NOT what we want.  Why is it true?  Because implications are still true when the antecedent is false, regardless of whether the consequent is true or not. \n    Remember, the statements we make must be true in the universe in which they take place.  The original statement:\n  \u00ac(\u2203 x) purple(x) ^ mushroom(x) ^ poisonous(x) \n  captures accurately the expression we set out to make: \"there is not some x, is purple and is a mushroom and is poisonous.\"  In other words, \"No Purple mushrooms are poisonous\"\n             "}], "Ankur Ramananda Baglodi": [{"time": "Mon Aug 29 2016 23:06:13 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "type": "New Post", "title": "Query regarding the homework", "text": "Hello,\n  I had couple of queries regarding homework which was assigned today.\n  1) Would we be able to submit the project\\source code multiple times?\n2) Would we get the list of failed\\successful test cases count when we test out our code in vocareum?\n  Thanks,\nAnkur"}, {"time": "Tue Aug 30 2016 16:25:39 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "type": "Normal Answer", "text": "Hi,\n  What about point number 2.

My understanding is shown as below.\nIf the sequence of live traffic inputs act like:\n...\nA B 1\nA D 2\n...\nthen the correct output route should be:A->B->C->F->G\n\nIf the sequence of live traffic inputs act like:\n...\nA D 2\nA B 1\n...\nthen the correct output route should be:A->D->F->G\n\nIs my understanding correct?

I fully understand your point because it's true that B exists in front of D in the priority queue. We will have 2 same path-cost nodes(C and D) in frontier set when the left route reaches node C and the right route reaches node D.Therefore it really makes sense that the result should depend on the sequence of C-F and D-F in the input.txt.\n  But I think my understanding makes sense as well since node A is the very first node that these 2 optimal routes begin to split. When it comes to 2 different optimal routes, the instruction in the homework asks us to \"explore (enqueue) multiple paths from the same intersection in the order in which they are listed in the live traffic inputs\". I think it depends  on how we understand this sentence. In my opinion my understanding satisfies this sentence as well, because node A is the very first common intersection those 2 routes have. Hence the result could depend on the sequence of A-B and A-D appears in the input.txt.\n  I really hope some instructor or TA could help me out of this special corner case.

If you emailed already, you will still not get back a response.\n- It is necessary that you know your Crowdmark paper number. This number can be found on the top right portion under the QR code and under \"midterm1\" beginning with a # and before the page number (e.g. 2 of 9). This number will be between 1 to 600. Your regrading request will not be accepted without referencing this Crowdmark paper number.\n  - To request a regrade, please fill in the form (link below) before Thursday night (midnight), which is a little more than 48 hours from now. You will need to sign into your USC Google account to access this form, and it records your email address too. The form asks which question you are asking for a regrade on, from Q1 to Q6. If you have questions on multiple subparts, e.g. 3(a) and 3(c), mention them all in the justification text box. You can fill up the form again for a different question. Please keep your justification brief and to the point.\nThe link to the regrade request form is - Regrading Form Link\n  - Most of the regrade requests we get every year are not accepted simply because the students do not read the solutions and rubric carefully or are overly optimistic with their partially correct solutions. For example, in this midterm, do not ask for a regrade if you have committed mistakes like the following - \nOn Q2 - if you don't have the complete path sequence correct for a subpart, you will lose 6 points. For e.g. if the correct path is A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I, and you wrote A-B-C-D-E-G-H-I, you will lose all points for the path (for each subpart). There is no partial grading within that.\nOn Q5 - if you wrote \"Yes\" as the answer, which is wrong, you get a 0/10 and 2/3rds of the class has committed this error. Please don't ask for a regrade in this case. If you wrote \"No\" but failed to provide a correct counter example and fully justified explanation, the same thing holds.\n  - We aim to complete all regrades by next Tuesday night. By then, you should see an additional comment \"regraded\" on your Crowdmark answers page (for whichever question you requested a regrade on), and your grade adjusted accordingly if there was an error earlier in grading.\n  - Please don't post follow-up questions to this post to discuss your regrading issues (such questions will be deleted). You can use the regrading form to let us know if you have questions on your answers or alternative solutions to some questions which we may not have covered in the rubric. If there are still any lingering questions about this, you can email me.\n  Cheers,\nOm Patri\nCS 561 TA\npatri@usc.edu\n#pin"}, {"time": "Fri Oct 28 2016 20:40:27 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "type": "Normal Answer", "text": "As a follow-up to this, we made a couple of changes in the solutions for regrading.\nQuestion 4 was regraded for all students, and alternative answers as discussed here were accepted.\nQuestion 6(e)'s correct answer is either B, C or D.\nNo other changes were made in the solutions.\n  All the regrading requests, either through the form, or those who emailed me, have been processed.\n  If you still have a concern with your grade for some question in Midterm 1, email me ASAP as I will finalize the grades on Tuesday, and they cannot be changed once finalized."}, {"time": "Thu Oct 20 2016 14:09:15 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "type": "Normal Answer", "text": "We are reviewing this.

After identifying the neighbors of A (B, C, D) you want to know how it is pushed into the queue.\n  This is my understanding of different search strategies,\n------------------\nThe term queue is used liberally everywhere in discussions in Piazza and in the class slides and can be a bit confusing with the Queue ADT. Let's call it frontier (more general, not related to any abstract data type). it is place where we keep the nodes that we want to explore in the future.\n  Actually, the search algorithms work by removing elements from the frontier, exploring them and adding them back. But which node should I explore in the frontier, how to process it and where to add it? We need to maintain some order in the frontier. The order in which we pull out the nodes from the frontier gave rise to the different search strategies.\n  All search strategies require a start point, we are searching a graph. The search grows/builds up/moves forward from the current node (this is done by exploring the neighbors, if available) or traverse back to explore another path. But which order do we explore the multiple neighbors? Here comes our favorite part of the entire homework, tie breaker.\n  So, Its important to know how we pop out the nodes than how we put it in, which defines the search strategy. The tie-breakers want us to answer this question: \"Which one of my neighbors do I take to explore next?\"\n  The tie-breaker that we are asked to implement is by popping from the frontier (all the neighbors, if available) in such a way that we explore the paths that have occurred earlier in the live traffic input. If we look at it from \"popping the elements out of frontier\" perspective, we can have many things clarified.

DFS only makes queuing decisions based off of parent/child relationship and whether a node has already been visited.

This implementation has been given in slide 113 in session02-04.pptx (Clean Robust Algorithm for UCS). This kind of implementation was also demonstrated by Prof. Tejada in one of the lectures for A*.\nThe graph given above is a reference to the first version of implementation which encounters the given procedure for A*.\n  2. In this version, UCS and A* does not check nodes which have been enqueued in the closed set. Once that node is in the closed set, irrespective of the fact that the current node (which is equal to a node in the closed set) may have a lower cost, it is never accessed.

Consider 2 sets: x \\in {A, B, C} and y \\in {P, Q, R}.\nNow, the FOL sentence correctly translates to \"Everyone in the world is loved by at least one person\". This would mean that P is loved by B, Q is loved by B and R is loved by A. The interpretation satisfies the universal quantifier constraint on y, as given in the sentence, and the interpretation is considered to be correct.\nYour interpretation is \"Everyone in the world loves at least one person\" which would mean that A loves P, B loves Q and C loves Q. In this case, the interpretation does not satisfy the universal quantifier constraint on y and the meaning has been altered as a consequence. In the given example, R is not loved by anyone and since R \\in y, it should be loved by someone in accordance to the FOL statement.\n  2. The given statements are general truths (only when blood relations are considered). Such facts hold in all circumstances and universal quantifiers need to be used. When an existential quantifier is used, there will always be a situation which will not conform with English interpretation.\nFor example, consider this FOL sentence: \u2203 x,y,z sibling(x,y) ^ mother(z,x) ^ mother(z,y). Such a statement implies that there are cases where a sibling of a person may not have the same mother as that person. Such a case is not possible in reality (only blood relations) but the sentence implies that such a case can exist. Existential quantifiers imply searching through sets of positive and negative examples and returning a positive instance.\nFor the next case, consider this FOL sentence: \u2203 x,y,w,z FirstCousin(x,y) ^ Parent(z,y) ^ Parent(w,x) ^sibling(w,z). Likewise, this statement implies that there are cases where a child's first cousin may not be the son/daughter of the person who is the sibling of the child's parent. Such a case is not possible in reality (only blood relations) but the sentence implies that such a case can exist.\nUniversal quantifiers cover all examples in the domain which is being examined. If there is an example which contradicts the universal statement, the statement fails for the entire set. Universal facts are expressed with a universal quantifier. In case of existential quantifiers, the English statement will contain words/phrases which imply a quantity (some, few, etc) which is lesser than the size of the universal set."}, {"time": "Fri Oct 28 2016 16:19:01 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "type": "New Post", "title": "Grades", "text": "When will the grades for HW2 be given?"}, {"time": "Tue Nov 01 2016 01:59:20 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "type": "Normal Answer", "text": "To Instructor: Can you explain why John can't be unified with F(y)?

What happens if the resolution refutation algorithm does not find any contradiction to a negated query, i.e. the algorithm continues for eternity? Does it mean that the negated query cannot be proved/contradicted by the KB?\n  2. In the document F2016Lecture14-15, the examples given for resolution refutation only take a negated query which given a Boolean response. In slide 138 of F2016Lecture14-15.pdf, the negated query to the KB acts as a function (supposed to give a name of a person for that query). The resolution steps lead to a contradiction as nothing can be inferred. How was Ellen given as the answer to the query? I did not understand how Ellen was inferred to be a mountain climber. Unlike backward chaining, the substitutions are not backed up.\n  3. If we unified clause 10 with clause 4 with the substitution {x1/Tony, x4/Snow}, the resulting predicate would be ~L(Ellen, Snow). If this is unified with clause 5, it will result in L(Tony, Snow). This clause will recursively unify with clause 4. In this case, when do we stop? Like backward chaining, does the actual implementation of resolution refutation keep track of explored clauses?\n  Thank you\n   "}, {"time": "Tue Nov 01 2016 08:49:33 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "type": "Normal Answer", "text": "I did not understand your answer."}, {"time": "Tue Nov 01 2016 12:39:29 GMT-0700 (PDT)", "type": "Selected Answer", "text": "AIMA 3rd edition incorrectly replaces z with G(z).

I've gone back to the pseudo-code in AIAMA (posted below) but I don't quite understand what some of the statements mean.\n  The way I have it implemented the second recursive Unify call \"Unify(Rest[x], Rest[y], Unify(First[x],First[y],Theta) )\" causes me to fail too early (I think). \n  Say x = (A(v1,v2) | B(v2,Bob) ) and y = (B(Jack,v3) | (~A(v4,v5)))\n  This should unify {v1/v4, v2/Jack, v3/Bob, v5/Jack} which would lead to resolution (B(Jack, Bob) | B(Jack, Bob)) which factors to B(Jack, Bob) correct?\n  If I follow the pseudo code, On the first entry of unify:\n x,y are both lists, The First[x] is A(v1,v2), First[y] is B(Jack,v3). \nI use this in the Unify statement for if x and y are both lists\nSo now when computing Unify for x = A(v1,v2), y = B(Jack,v3)\nBoth x and y are compounds, Op[x] = A Op[y] = B\nSo go to Unify statement where x = A, y = B\nBoth x and y are function symbols and they are not equivalent so I go to \"else return failure\"\nThis cascades up and the whole thing fails here.\n  I also seem to fail on sentences that have different number of predicates. In fact the only time it seems to work is if both sentences have the same number of predicates, the predicates all have the same names, and they are all ordered in the same way. I'm clearly misreading the pseudo code, I'm guessing I'm misunderstanding what is meant by \"Compound?\" \"List?\" and how \"First\" and \"Rest\" are supposed to work.\n  Sorry if this doesn't make any sense.

I just followed the book's pseudo code. But as I showed it doesn't seem to work if the ordering of the predicates are different. It also fails if there are a different number of predicates, or if some of the predicates don't have matching names. Both of those scenarios occur very often so it doesn't seem like the book's pseudo-code works with them. I've spent a bunch of time trying to force it to work by re-ordering predicates (which helps some) and trying to only match parts of the sentences with the same predicates (which is faulty, because it removes conflicts that might be important), but I still can't seem to do it.

So any equal value we get in minimax is accurate and exact.\n  But in alpha-beta pruning, we can't give this priority as we do in minimax. (if we are adhering to the textbook algorithm) In general, our normal alpha-beta pruning algorithm only initialize alpha and beta value once at the root of the tree, which should be -infinity and +infinity. So any later steps will only update alpha and beta value, not initializing them. (here I have to mention this point, because this point is the mainly difference cause the trouble, And I believe lots of students may have this problem if they write their alpha-beta pruning based on their minimax. Because it is easy to write into a different alpha-beta pruning but get same results with test case 3)\n  So the different way to do the alpha-beta pruning is that we initialize alpha and beta value every time we get back to depth 1. (in our homework, depth 1 is the step we place our first player on the board)\n  Here I will call the normal alpha-beta pruning as #1, and another one as #2.\nIf we use #1 and #2 both on the same board, we will get different sequence of values at depth 1. Here I will give an example (I think it is also reasonable based on definition):\n2\nALPHABETA\nX\n2\n1 2\n1 2\n..\n..\nvalues at depth 1 of #1: -1 0 0 0\nvalues at depth 1 of #2: -1 0 -1 0\n  Now lets get back to our homework test case 3\nThe results of #1:\nA5 Stake\n..XX.\n..XOX\n...O.\n..OO.\nX....\nand the values at depth 1 is:\n-12 -15 X X -11\n-11 -11 X O X\n-12 -18 26 O 24\n25 25 O O 23\n26 26 26 26 23\n  The results of #2 is same with test case 3, and the values at depth 1 is:\n-12 -16 X X -11\n-12 -28 X O X\n-12 -46 26 O -31\n-35 -28 O O -30\n-7 -55 -46 -46 -33\n  It is obvious that #2 can give correct answer (I mean \"correct\" result matched with test case 3), and make me pass every cases provided.

It's just because we can use different tricks on our code. I used an array visited[row][col] to avoid duplicated moves on grid(row,col)[if it was visited, then don't need to visit again]. Because you mentioned that Stake first and then Raid separatelly, I think that the first idea comes to most of students when saw this requirement is to loop over Stake(empty space) first from top-left to bottom-right, and then Raid('X' or 'O') from top-left to bottom-right. Maybe your solution is the better way to avoid duplication, but it's not the ONLY way. It's not FAIR and WISE to say something is definitely wrong!\nAlso, I think this(the way we use) already involved in the implementation details. It should not be discussed. We are supposed to finish our HW individually.\n  Finally, some suggestions for your reference:\n1. There is no any official document(lecture slide, HW description) mentioned that all of the things discussed on Piazza are also the REQUIREMENT for HW. It's just mentioned Piazza is a good way to discuss our questions about this course.\n  2. I really appreciate the lots of time you guys spend to answer students' questions. But, how to make the time you spend on Piazza more MEANINGFUL?\n  Posting a summary for all of additional requirements discussed on Piazza as [Instr Note] to notify every student before deadline(like one week before). [Also it can avoid repeated answers and some similar question]\n  Rather than hoping that all of students would go through all of materials discussed on Piazza. It's impossible for a student who already finished the HW and is overwhelmed by some other HWs on other courses to go through all of posts and discussions before deadline. We are not taking only one class and we are not supposed to know EVERY student's questions. Just like my followup on this topic, I don't think all of students would go through what I said here except some of students who may have same question with me. You mentioned that you modified the instructors answer to that post, maybe only you know that. Students seldom review the posts they saw already. \nThe HW requirement was keeping changing even though time is close to deadline. It's highly possible that we missed something especially when time is close to deadline and we already finished it.\n  Hope you can consider about that! I mean it! Thank you!

The way I usually do it is i go from the parent down to the one variable in consideration. So first you have no observation/assumptions that is given. You have to substitute 2 values for D0(0.6) and D1(0.4) and multiply accordingly to the table below ( Grade table ). For example : now P(I0,G1) = P(D0)*P(I0,D0,G1) + P(D1)*P(I0,D1,G1) = 0.6 * 0.3 + 0.4*0.05 = 0.2. Now that D is gone, you do the same for I. ,e.g : P(G1) = P(I0)*P(I0,G1) + P(I1)*P(I1,G1) = 0.7*0.2 + 0.3*0.74 = 0.362. Now that I is gone you end up with the last table, do the same.P(L1) = P(G1)*P(G1,L1) + P(G2)*P(G2,L1) + P(G3)*P(G3,L1) = 0.9 * 0.362 + 0.6*0.2884 + 0.01*0.3496 = 0.50234 . (P(G2) , P(G3) is calculated on previous step ).\nWhen you are given(observation is made) like in 2). P(L1| I0). You could cut the row having I1 when calculating P(D0,G1) and P(D1,G1) . Speaking of I1, the table is likely wrong ( Do you see any I1 anywhere, the last two row of Grade table is of I1 variable). Professor please verify slides when you adapt it. Well, i traced it down and it seems that it comes from one university to another to ... a chapter in a book which the table is wrong too. Cant blame ya, the source is wrong.
